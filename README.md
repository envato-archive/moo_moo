Description
-----------

Implements most of the functionality of the OpenSRS XML API. For full
documentation of the OpenSRS XML API see
<http://www.opensrs.com/site/resources/documentation>

Usage
-----

First, create an opensrs object for the namespace you want to use:

    lookup = MooMoo::Lookup.new(
      "horizon.opensrs.net",
      "<YOUR_KEY>",
      "<YOUR_RESELLER_USER>",
      "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
    )

Or configure MooMoo and you can initialize it without any arguments:

    MooMoo.configure do |config|
      config.host     = "horizon.opensrs.net"
      config.key      = "<YOUR_KEY>"
      config.username = "<YOUR_RESELLER_USER>"
      config.password = "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
    end

    ...

    lookup = MooMoo::Lookup.new

As an alternative, you can create a .moomoo.yml file in your project root with a default
configuration for the library to use.

Now you can call a variety of commands to deal with domains, nameservers, etc.
Here's how to check the availability of a domain name:

    res = lookup.lookup_domain(:attributes => { :domain => 'example.com' })
    p res.success?

    true

Each method returns an `OpenSRSResponse` object which you can use to determine
if the call was successful and retrieve the response code and/or error
message. The result variable is a hash that contains all of the relevant data
returned by the call.

Currently, there is support for the following services:

  * Cookie
  * Lookup
  * Nameserver
  * Provisioning
  * Transfer

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have
  your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
  ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
